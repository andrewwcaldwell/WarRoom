This is a new hobby concept project for me. . As a big fantasy football fan, I thought this up as an opportuninty
to test out some of the various chart and graph libraries available and practice some more dynamic template changes
via custom angular directives. Plan for now is this will be ready in time for me to use as a draft aid when drafting my team 
in July or August. Also will be shooting for a shmorgasboard business dashboard demo, flexible KPI rendering visual feast.
I want to have at least 6 charts that have drag and drop to "dock" on key view areas of the dashboard and minimize / hide.
