Demo Dat Project..

-A-
First thought is something with anayltics dash board or  some sort comparative analysis tools.

Without checking to see how good of APIs are a available. Im thinking an advanced fantasy football draft tool might be fun to make up using various football apis that are avaiable.

Concept would create custom grades and rankings based on user defined weight or emphasis on index numbers used by various tools that otherwise operate on hard coded comparisons, math, and statistics.

I would probably lean heavily on the most polished graphs and charts library I could find and present user with multiple views of positions, team transfer updates and individual player bios... 

Kinda Old hat but would be fun to do the anaylitics side and try to up the game from a UX standpoint over what the major providers offer (so complacent in their hegemony of this industry).
